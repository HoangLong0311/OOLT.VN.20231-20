Overview & gameplay: [Hướng dẫn cách chơi Cờ Gánh ( Cờ chém) (thuthuatchoi.com)](https://thuthuatchoi.com/huong-dan-cach-choi-co-ganh.html)

Demo game: [Trò chơi dân gian: "Hướng dẫn chơi Cờ Gánh" - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIPAwJslut4)

Specifications:
In this project, you will make an application for 2 users to play the traditional game Cờ gánh.
1. GUI: You can freely design your own UI; however, since this project is to design a program
using OOP, there is no need to pay too much focus on the interface. You can also use some
image references of the web game in the link provided, or look for any materials you like.
2. Design: The application must have these functions:
+ On the main screen:
> - Start: Start the game. For convenience, you do not have to create different difficulties.
> - Exit: Exit the program. Be sure to ask users if they really want to quit the game.
> - Help: Show guide for playing the game.
+ In the game:
> - Gameboard: The chessboard is a flat surface divided into 16 squares with diagonal,
horizontal, and vertical lines representing the allowed paths of the pieces. The
chessboard has 25 intersection points from the above lines, which are also 25 places to
place pieces when playing.
> - For each turn, the application must show clearly whose turn it is. A player will select
one of his pieces and a valid point in the chessboard to place the piece. The pieces will
change the color if eaten by the opponent.
> - The game ends when there is only one color remaining on the chessboard.
> - For simplicity, you do not have to build a bot to play with human
